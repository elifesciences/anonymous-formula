# anonymous-formula

This is a formula for an EC2 instance without any credentials in it, but that should be able to run [builder](https://github.com/elifesciences/builder) to check out the [Continuum projects](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-continuum-documentation/) and instantiate them on AWS.

The key provided here should give access to the thedailybugle.org's [builder-private](https://github.com/elife-anonymous-user/builder-private) copy. You may see a 404 at this link, because as the name says this is a private repository used for testing on AWS and Github accounts not tied in any way to eLife.
